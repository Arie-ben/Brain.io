# Hackathon - Brain.io
Brain.io, a chrome extension that predicts the best web page to view next based on your own and the community's searches

Back_end.py : this python script predicts the next web page you may wanna visit, based on your and other people's history.

This project is at a very early stage.
The next step is to make the link between front end and back end scripts. Then, the objective is to build a SQL database that would update automatically.
